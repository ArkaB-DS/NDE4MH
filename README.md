## Project Title
`Nonparametric Kernel Density Estimation for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm`

## Abstract
> In this report, we discuss how the rejection step of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm affects kernel density estimation. We elaborate on the theory developed by [1] by providing extensive proofs and explore applications exhibiting their efficiency in various problems.
